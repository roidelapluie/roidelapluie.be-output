    My first Open Source contribution
</a></h1>
<div class="content text-justify">
    <p>The first Open-Source contribution I remember happened on December 2005.
It happened on Gaim, which is now known as <a href="https://pidgin.im/">Pidgin</a>.</p>

<p>It was not a big contribution: I did not like the arrows shown when moving
discussion tabs. Those arrows where plain red. I <a href="https://bitbucket.org/pidgin/main/commits/9afbf5b7240da81a1a796a421c2000487805ad67">created new ones</a> (using The
Gimp), with a gradient. It did not take a long time to make them, but it was
definitively an improvement.</p>

<p>Here it is: <img src="/images/tb_drag_arrow_up.png" alt="my first contribution" /></p>

<p>It was quickly merged (&lt; 2 hours). And it was important for me, because at that
moment I understood that I could improve the tools I was using, and that
everyone would get those improvements. That was the beginning of 12 years
of Open Source contributions.</p>

    Augeas resource for mgmt
</a></h1>
<div class="content text-justify">
    

<p>Last week, I joined the <a href="https://github.com/purpleidea/mgmt">mgmt</a> hackathon,
just after Config Management Camp Ghent. It helped me understanding how mgmt
actually works and that helped me to introduce two improvements in the codebase:
prometheus support, and an augeas resource.</p>

<p>I will blog later about the prometheus support, today I will focus about the
Augeas resource.</p>

<h2 id="defining-a-resource">Defining a resource</h2>

<p>Currently, mgmt does not have a DSL, it only uses plain yaml.</p>

<p>Here is how you define an Augeas resource:</p>

<pre><code>---
graph: mygraph
resources:
  augeas:
  - name: sshd_config
    lens: Sshd.lns
    file: &quot;/etc/ssh/sshd_config&quot;
    sets:
      - path: X11Forwarding
        value: no
edges:
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, the augeas resource takes several parameters:</p>

<ul>
<li>lens: the lens file to load</li>
<li>file: the path to the file that we want to change</li>
<li>sets: the paths/values that we want to change</li>
</ul>

<p>Setting file will create a Watcher, which means that each time you change that
file, mgmt will check if it is still aligned with what you want.</p>

<h2 id="code">Code</h2>

<p>The code can be found there: <a href="https://github.com/purpleidea/mgmt/pull/128/files">https://github.com/purpleidea/mgmt/pull/128/files</a></p>

<p>We are using go bindings for Augeas: <a href="https://github.com/dominikh/go-augeas/">https://github.com/dominikh/go-augeas/</a>
Unfortunately, those bindings only support a recent version of Augeas. It was
needed to vendor it to make it build on travis.</p>

<h2 id="future-plans">Future plans</h2>

<p>Future plans regarding this resource is to add some parameters, probably a
parameter to use as Puppet &ldquo;onlyif&rdquo; parameter, and a &ldquo;rm&rdquo; parameter.</p>

    mgmt
</a></h1>
<div class="content text-justify">
    

<p>At <a href="http://cfgmgmtcamp.eu/">Config Management Camp</a>, <a href="https://ttboj.wordpress.com/">James</a> was once again presenting <a href="https://github.com/purpleidea/mgmt">mgmt</a>.
He presented the project one year ago, on his <a href="https://ttboj.wordpress.com/2016/01/18/next-generation-configuration-mgmt/">blog</a>. There are multiple
ideas behind mgmt (as you can read on his blog):</p>

<ul>
<li>Parallel execution</li>
<li>Event driven</li>
<li>Distributed topology</li>
</ul>

<p>And all of that makes a lot of sense. I really like it. I do really think that
this might become a huge deal in the future. But there are a couple of concerns
I would like to raise.</p>

<h3 id="it-is-james-project">It is James&rsquo; project</h3>

<p>James has been developing it since 2013. His ideas are great, however the
project is still at its very beginning, not usable yet, even for the more brave
out there. The fact that it is so early and that even early adopters have a lot
to do, makes it difficult to contribute. Even if there are 20 code contributors
to the project, James is the one that does most of the job.</p>

<p>I do like the fact that James knows Puppet very well. It means we speak the same
languages, he knows the problem Puppet users face, and is one of the best people
to challenge the config management community.</p>

<p><em>How to improve that</em>: get involved, code, try&hellip; We need to bring this to a
more stable and usable shape before we can drag more and more contributors.</p>

<h3 id="it-is-scary-because-it-is-fast">It is scary because it is fast</h3>

<p>With traditional configuration management, when you screw up some thing, you
still have the time to fix your configuration before it is applied everywhere.
Puppet running every 30 minutes is a good example. You have a chance to fix some
things in emergency before everyone gets them.</p>

<p>Even ansible is an order of magnitude slower than mgmt. And that makes it scary.</p>

<p><em>How to improve that</em>: we might be able to tell mgmt to do canary releases. That
would be awesome, something really great for the future of mgmt. It is quite
hard to do so with traditional config management, but it might become native in
the future with mgmt. That would be awesome.</p>

<h3 id="it-is-hard-to-understand">It is hard to understand</h3>

<p>mgmt internals are not as easy to understand as other tools. You can be scary at
first sight. It is using directed acyclic graphes, which enables it do do things
in parallel. Even if other config management use something close to that, in
mgmt you need to have a deep understanding of them, especially when you want to
contribute (which is the only thing you can do now). It is not hard, it is just
a price we do not have to pay with the other tools.</p>

<p><em>How to improve that</em>: continue improving mgmt, remove bugs in that graph so we
are not badly affected by bugs in that graph, and we do not need to understand
everything to contribute (e.g to write new resource types or fix bugs in
resources). You can deal with Puppet, and know nothing about its internals.</p>

<h3 id="golang-is-challenging">Golang is challenging</h3>

<p>mgmt is written in go. Whether it is a great language or not is not what matters
here. What matters is that in the Ops world, go is not so popular. I am afraid
that go is not as extensible as Ruby, and the fact that you need to recompile it
to extend it is also a pain.</p>

<p><em>How to improve that</em>: nothing mgmt can do. The core open-source infrastructure
tools nowadays are mainly written in go. Sysadmins need to evolve here.</p>

<h3 id="the-agpl-license">The AGPL license</h3>

<p>I love copyleft. However, most of the world does not. This part of mgmt will be
one of the things that will slow down its adoption. Ansible is GPL-Licensed, but
the difference with Ansible and mgmt is that the last one is written in go, as a
library. You could use mgmt just as a lib, backed into other softwares. But the
licencing makes it too hard.</p>

<p>For a lot of other projects, the license will be the first thing they will see.
They will not ever look deeper to see if mgmt firs their needs or not.</p>

<p>For now I am afraid mgmt would just become a thing in the Red Hat world, where
by default lots of things are copyleft, so there would be no problem with
including mgmt.</p>

<p><em>How to improve that</em>: we need to speak with the community, and decide if we
want to speed up the adoption, or to try to get more people to contribute.</p>

<h3 id="the-name">The name</h3>

<p>Naming things is hard. But mgmt is probably not the best name. It does not sell
a dream, it does not stand out. It is impossible to do some internet searches
about it.</p>

<p><em>How to improve that</em>: we need to start thinking about a better name, that would
reflect the community.</p>

<h3 id="containers">containers</h3>

<p>I am not sure about what will be the future of mgmt in a container world. Not
everything is moving to that world nowadays, but a lot of things actually is. I
just don&rsquo;t know. Need to think further about it.</p>

<h2 id="but-is-there-anything-positive">But, is there anything positive?</h2>

<p>You can read the list above as bad things. But I see that list a my initial
ideas about how we can bring the project to the next level, how we can making it
more appealing for external contributors.</p>

<p>mgmt is one of the projects that I would qualify as unique and really creative.
Creativity is a gift nowadays. It is just awesome, just give it a bit more time.</p>

<p>We look forward to see it more stable, and to see a language that will take
advantage of it, and enable us to easily write mgmt catalogs (currently it is
all yaml). Stay tuned!</p>

    Gitslave for Jenkins Pipelines
</a></h1>
<div class="content text-justify">
    <p>At customer, we are using <a href="http://gitslave.sourceforge.net/">GitSlave</a>, as a way
to build and release multiple releases at the same time. Gitslave is like git
submodules, except that you always get the latest version of the submodules (no
commits needed in the super repository).</p>

<p>For CI, we are using <a href="https://jenkins.io">Jenkins</a>. A Jenkins plugin was developed for it.
Unfortunately, it was written in a way that would make the work of opensourcing
that module too big (IP was all over the place in the testsuite). In addition to
that, the integration with Jenkins was not as best as with the Git plugin.</p>

<p>The multi scm plugin is not an option as the list of repos to clone is in a
file; and that it sometimes changes.</p>

<p>Fortunately, we will eventually drop that proprietary module, switching to the
new <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Pipeline+Plugin">Pipeline plugin</a>.
I would then like to share a Jenkinsfile script that takes the <code>.gitslave</code>
configuration file and clones every repository. Please note that it takes some
parameters: <code>gitBaseUrl</code>, and <code>superRepo</code>. It will clone the repositories in
multiple threads.</p>

<p>That script is under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/">CC0</a>.</p>

<p>Why do we run in threads and not everything in parallel? First, <a href="https://jenkins.io/projects/blueocean/">Blue Ocean</a>
<a href="https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-39770">can only display 100 threads</a>. Running several operations in all the repos
would end up with more that 100 threads. Plus it is probably not clever to
run such a big amount of parallelism.</p>

<p>What is still to be done? We do not delete repositories that disappear from the
<code>.gitslave</code> file.</p>

<p>Here is the result:</p>

<p>PS: GitSlave is named GitSlave. I do not like the name &ndash; and kudos to the
Jenkins team to drop the Master/Slave terminology as part of the Jenkins 2.0
release.</p>

because those were things we needed. We needed that so much that the community
just went for its own variant, in ruby (<code>create_resources</code>). Being able to
remove <code>create_resources</code> is great.</p>

<p>However, as <a href="https://daenney.github.io/2016/10/17/goodbye-puppet.html">Daniele stated</a>,
Puppet has quite reached Feature Complete. That means that we made Puppet work
for all our needs. Even Puppet 3.x was feature complete. You can/could build
anything with Puppet.</p>

<p>Puppet, Inc. is running in all kind of directions now and they start
implementing new features everywhere. Instead of allowing us to do more and more
crazy things with the Puppet DSL, they should start wondering the question: what
is the real value for the users? It looks like the game now is to throw away as
most features as possible &ndash; but hey, that is not what we expect from Puppet.</p>

<p>Puppet gets to a point when we can actually stop learning it, and focus on all
the other tasks. The job is not to automate everything nowadays &ndash; because
everything is already automated. We want a Puppet that is transparent, fast,
silent. We want a Puppet that just works.</p>

<p>There are lots of bad moves in the last years. One of the latest example is the
closed source app orchestration, which breaks the spirit of Puppet to design the
final state. Strangely enough, I never needed such a thing. Instead of adapting
tools to everyone, maybe some time should be spent to explain people HOW to
design infrastructures. The fact that you need the app orchestrator maybe
means that you do something wrong.</p>

<p>One other bad move is the <a href="https://docs.puppet.com/pe/latest/puppet_server_metrics.html">Puppet server metrics</a>. That was such a great
idea to expose metrics with the graphite API. Obviously, in the monitoring
world, everyone speaks graphite. The bad move was to decide that the open source
users don&rsquo;t deserve it. Yes, the same users that write and contribute to the
real value of Puppet, the open source modules on github and the forge.</p>

<p>What actually triggered that article is a <a href="https://docs.puppet.com/puppet/4.8/reference/release_notes.html">new puppet function</a>, called <code>return</code>.
Let&rsquo;s go over a quick example:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#e5e5e5;background-color:#000;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-puppet" data-lang="puppet"><span style="color:#fff;font-weight:bold">class</span> <span style="color:#007f7f">bar</span> {<span style="color:#f00">
</span><span style="color:#f00"></span>  <span style="color:#fff;font-weight:bold">notify</span> {<span style="color:#0ff;font-weight:bold">&#39;foo&#39;</span>:}<span style="color:#f00">
</span><span style="color:#f00"></span>  <span style="color:#007f7f">return</span>()<span style="color:#f00">
</span><span style="color:#f00"></span>  <span style="color:#fff;font-weight:bold">notify</span> {<span style="color:#0ff;font-weight:bold">&#39;bar&#39;</span>:}<span style="color:#f00">
</span><span style="color:#f00"></span>}<span style="color:#f00">
</span><span style="color:#f00"></span><span style="color:#fff;font-weight:bold">include</span> <span style="color:#007f7f">bar</span></code></pre></div>
<p>And here is the result:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#e5e5e5;background-color:#000;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">Notice: Compiled catalog for localhost in environment production in 0.08 seconds
Notice: foo
Notice: /Stage[main]/Bar/Notify[foo]/message: defined &#39;message&#39; as &#39;foo&#39;
Notice: Applied catalog in 0.03 seconds</code></pre></div>
<p>Great!</p>

<p>This is the kind of features that adds complexity for nothing. All it does is
adding complexity and making it hard to debug manifests. It is really hard to
find usecases for that <code>return</code> function. And in you have one &ndash; you might as
well think twice.</p>

<p>Puppet lost is soul. When previously reading Puppet manifests was easy and
really intuitive, now you need to deal with complex functions and you barely
now what will end in the catalog at first sight.</p>

<p>I kinda miss my past parser.</p>
