    I&#39;ve backed Matchstick
</a></h1>
<div class="content text-justify">
    <p>I have backed <a href="http://matchstick.tv">Matchstick</a>, the HDMI stick based on <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en/firefox/os/">Firefox OS</a>.
It is the first crowdfunding project I participate. And I hope it won&rsquo;t be the last one.</p>

<p>There are a few reasons why I have chosen to do so.</p>

<p>The first reason is the open-source part of that project. An open-source software
combined with open-source hardware, that is everything I like. Good philosophy is always a good point.</p>

<p>Next that project is exciting. An easy to use HDMI stick for my TV is something really cool. I do
not have a &ldquo;smart&rdquo; TV but still my TV has some HDMI input and USB plugs (to power the stick).</p>

<p>Third part: it is cheap. It worth its 18 USD. I don&rsquo;t even look at opponents price there, because no
opponent is as open-source as this. I even find that the announced market price (25 USD) is acceptable.</p>

<p>Also I am really happy to see an new device that IS NOT run by Android. Android is
too mainstream I think, and even if it is open-source, the Google-way of managing it
is not something I like.</p>

<p>Relatedly to the previous point, it is important that the project is not made by <a href="https://mozilla.org">Mozilla</a>.
Open-Source and standards that are really good are forked and used by third-parties
companies. That is kind of a quality proof.</p>

<p>Now we will see what we will get at the end, if the promises will be fulfilled and how will the stick
behave in real conditions. I also hope that a lot of the apps ecosystem will also be open-source.
I am waiting February to see what&rsquo;s going on and to put some more feedback there.</p>

    Vagrant puppet_server tip
</a></h1>
<div class="content text-justify">
    <p>This is a small tip for everyone using the <a href="https://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/provisioning/puppet_agent.html">vagrant puppet_server provisioner</a>, which allows you to run a puppet agent inside your vagrant box:</p>

<pre><code>Vagrant.configure(&quot;2&quot;) do |config|
  config.vm.box = &quot;vStone/centos-6.x-puppet.3.x&quot;
  config.vm.hostname = &quot;puppet.vagrant.inuits.eu&quot;
  config.vm.box_check_update = false
  config.vm.network &quot;private_network&quot;, ip: &quot;192.168.33.2&quot;
  config.vm.provision &quot;puppet_server&quot; do |puppet|
    puppet.puppet_server = &quot;puppetmaster.vagrant.inuits.eu&quot;
    puppet.options = [&quot;--environment&quot;, &quot;devel&quot;, &quot;--test&quot;]
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>The tip is to add <code>puppet.options = [&quot;--test&quot;]</code> so you have the debug information, the diff of the files, &hellip; If you want more you can also add <code>--debug</code>.</p>

<p>By default the provisioner uses the <code>--onetime</code> option which is not verbose at all.</p>

    It&#39;s not time to split Linux distros in two
</a></h1>
<div class="content text-justify">
    <p><em>This article is a reaction to the following article:</em> <a href="http://www.infoworld.com/d/data-center/its-time-split-linux-in-two-249704">It&rsquo;s time to split Linux distros in two</a> written by <a href="https://twitter.com/pvenezia">@pvenezia</a>.</p>

<p>There are a lot of changes nowadays in the way GNU/Linux evolves: systemd, steamOS, android, and a bunch of other stuff in several domains.</p>

<p>So I read Paul&rsquo;s article with attention because it&rsquo;s seems that GNU/Linux will evolve a lot in the following years. He is right when he points out that on one side we want stability and scalability and on the other side we want performances and wide hardware support. But it does not mean that we want to have to chose from these two aspects.</p>

<p>Linux can do all the things. And it can do them right. I don&rsquo;t want to have to choose between server and desktop, what I want is a smallish image that I can use and deploy and then choose whatever I want to install on it. I want to be able to give a kickstart and eventually get a GNOME Desktop or a httpd server.</p>

<p>The open-source world is moving fast. Containers, declarative distributions, and who knows what will be the next hipster stuff.. There is no room for a ballot screen that would allow you to download a desktop or a server-centric distribution.</p>

<p>One of the reasons is that a desktop should be able to run server applications and a server should be able to run desktop softwares. Let me show you some example.</p>

<p>On desktop A, a developer is running a lot of different virtual machines. To facilitate his work, he has deployed a small DNS server on it, so it is easy to work accross several projects. If the distributions were splitted, which one should he use?</p>

<p>On a server, I want to run acceptance tests for a website. So I need a jenkins slave, Xvfb (headless X11 server) and a browser. Which distribution should I use?</p>

<p>There are many risks in splitting distributions into desktop/server roles:</p>

<ul>
<li>No one would have all the packages he needs</li>
<li>Server-centric distributions would have outdated desktop-related packages and vice-versa</li>
<li>People would install packages that come from anywhere coz they are on the other distributions</li>
<li>There would be a lot of double work - work that has to take place in both desktop and server distributions</li>
</ul>

<p>But, if you look closer, you will also understand that there is already a natural way of using distributions. SteamOS and Fedora will be used more as desktops, and CentOS will more be used as server. The limits are however less important with debian-related systems.</p>

<p>In some special cases like SteamOS, it is right that Desktop support will come first. Maybe they won&rsquo;t package httpd or bind, but that would be their choice. There is not need for a big schism into every distribution because one of them has chosen to support only one of the two sides.</p>

<p>To conclude this article, I like the idea that with a small image, I can get whatever I want. It&rsquo;s really cellular differentiation. Let&rsquo;s avoid to do mistakes because of systemd or any other software. Let&rsquo;s follow what the community wants, and what business needs. Let&rsquo;s keep Linux distributions capable of handling all the stuff we love.</p>
