    The LibreOffice Calc 1024 columns bug
</a></h1>
<div class="content text-justify">
    <p>Sometimes it is sad to see some quite important bugs that last in time.</p>

<p>One of the last one I hit is a limitation in LibreOffice Calc. It does not support
<a href="https://bugs.documentfoundation.org/show_bug.cgi?id=50916">calc spreadsheet with more that 1024 columns</a>.</p>

<p>That bug was already <a href="https://bz.apache.org/ooo/show_bug.cgi?id=86049">opened in 2008</a> in OpenOffice.</p>

<p>It is really a blocker bug for people that receive spreadsheets that have a lof of columns. For example I have
seen a spreadsheet with one column per day. After 3 years it could not be opened by libreoffice (&gt;1024 columns).</p>

<p>A short fix is to change the maximum number of columns but this would increase memory consumption for every opened spreadsheet. And it is not trivial for everyone to <a href="https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Development/BuildingOnLinux">recompile libreoffice</a>. Here is how you update to 2048:</p>

<pre><code>::patch
diff --git a/sc/inc/address.hxx b/sc/inc/address.hxx
index f6650d4..f1699af 100644
--- a/sc/inc/address.hxx

@@ -58,7 +58,7 @@ const SCSIZE   SCSIZE_MAX   = ::std::numeric_limits&lt;SCSIZE&gt;::max();
 // The maximum values. Defines are needed for preprocessor checks, for example

-#define MAXCOLCOUNT_DEFINE 1024
+#define MAXCOLCOUNT_DEFINE 2048

 // Count values
 const SCROW       MAXROWCOUNT    = MAXROWCOUNT_DEFINE;
</code></pre>

<p>Of course there are also alternatives like <a href="http://www.gnumeric.org/">gnumeric</a> or <a href="https://userbase.kde.org/KCells">kcells</a> that supports large spreadsheets, if they are simple enough.</p>

    Percona XtraBackup 2.2.10 is incompatible with MariaDB 10.0
</a></h1>
<div class="content text-justify">
    

<p><a href="http://www.percona.com/doc/percona-xtrabackup/2.2/">Percona XtraBackup</a> is
probably the most relevant open-source backup solution for both
<a href="http://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</a> and <a href="https://mariadb.org/">MariaDB</a>. It has all
the required features that you need to backup your database, especially if you use innodb (or xtradb).</p>

<p>One of the features are Incremental backups. It is an easy way to get
a consistent backup of your databases in a short amount of time.</p>

<p>But the latest version of XtraBackup
(<a href="http://www.percona.com/doc/percona-xtrabackup/2.2/release-notes/2.2/2.2.10.html">2.2.10</a>)
breaks that feature with MariaDB 10.0. And it is not a bug, it is a feature.
Let me explain: it is due to an old feature that was not enabled.</p>

<p>Two years ago (exactly), XtraBackup got a feature called <a href="https://github.com/percona/percona-xtrabackup/commit/a37c7cbca557e94bb5f5ffe4ae02378dcf98daf7">bitmap-based incremental backups</a>. But that feature was (at least partly) not working, as that feature was always disabled. It was fixed <a href="https://github.com/percona/percona-xtrabackup/commit/a39237dd1a4de653e205e63b81ae5c4c5659116d">recently</a>.</p>

<p>The fix enables that feature in MariaDB 10.0. When an incremental backup is done,
XtraBackup issues the following command:</p>

<pre><code>::mysql
FLUSH NO_WRITE_TO_BINLOG CHANGED_PAGE_BITMAPS
</code></pre>

<p>Which does not exist in MariaDB:</p>

<pre><code>You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to
your MariaDB server version for the right syntax to use near
CHANGED_PAGE_BITMAPS.
</code></pre>

<p>There are two upstream bugs for this: <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/percona-xtrabackup/+bug/1444541">one for XtraBackup</a>
and <a href="https://mariadb.atlassian.net/browse/MDEV-7472">another one for MariaDB</a>.
It will probably not be fixed in MariaDB (at least not in a close future), but
we can reasonably expect that XtraBackup 2.2.11 will contain a fix for this.</p>

<h3 id="command-line-workaround">Command-line workaround</h3>

<p>The recommended workaround for MariaDB is to use the <code>--incremental-force-scan</code> option
as <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/percona-xtrabackup/+bug/1444541/comments/5">pointed out by Sergei Glushchenko</a>.</p>

<h3 id="patch-for-backward-compatibility">Patch for backward compatibility</h3>

<p>The following patch allows you to break the feature detection to have backward
command-line compatibility:</p>

    Google to shut down Google Code

<div class="content text-justify">
    <p><a href="http://google-opensource.blogspot.be/2015/03/farewell-to-google-code.html">Google</a> is <a href="http://google-opensource.blogspot.be/2015/03/farewell-to-google-code.html">shutting down Google Code</a>. It was quite expected that it would join the Google graveyard. It was a cool service but the UI never got a lot of attention. Parsing a source tree or looking at issues was like traveling back in 2006.</p>

<p>This should however be a reminder that all of these platforms (Google Code, Github, Bitbucket) are centralized and closed-source. Even if Github loves Open-Source, and is loved by the Open-Source community, it is a totally closed platform.</p>

<p>Which alternatives do you have them if you want to self-host your repositories? A bunch of them actually. The most bling-bling one being <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/downloads/">Gitlab</a>. You also have Gitorious, Gitblit, Gitlist, &hellip; There are a huge number of them. There are even complete forges out there like <a href="http://codingteam.net/project/codingteam">CodingTeam</a>.</p>

<p>The real question is how to combine visibility and freedom? My guess is that will only be possible with self-hosted projects being mirrored on upstream sites. Your code continues to be free, and hosted in several places.</p>

<p>I personally use Github because there are a lot of people there. A project that is not on Github is even a python project or a dead project, in most of the cases. Sourceforge is only the place to download tarballs and Google Code was not really used anymore.</p>

<p>Long live GitHub, GitLab and every other alternative places where we will put our code and make it live. Long live git. And thanks Google Code.</p>

    Puppet Server
</a></h1>
<div class="content text-justify">
    <p>I have tested <a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet-server">Puppet Server</a>, the
new puppet master implementation in Clojure. And I am quite happy.</p>

<p><strong>It just works</strong></p>

<p>The first amazing thing was that it did just work the same way as Puppetmaster.</p>

<p>I did not need to change any configuration file. Every custom function and module just worked like before.</p>

<p>I am using the <a href="https://github.com/theforeman/puppet-puppet">puppet-puppet</a> from <a href="https://theforeman.org">the Foreman</a>, which already have a <code>server_implementation</code> parameter. Switching it to <code>puppetserver</code> just did the trick.</p>

<p>I also needed to pass the <code>puppet_service_name</code> parameter to <code>puppetdb::master::config</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#e5e5e5;background-color:#000;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-puppet" data-lang="puppet"><span style="color:#fff;font-weight:bold">class</span> {<span style="color:#f00">
</span><span style="color:#f00"></span>  <span style="color:#0ff;font-weight:bold">&#39;::puppet&#39;</span>:<span style="color:#f00">
</span><span style="color:#f00"></span>    <span style="color:#007f7f">server</span>                =&gt; <span style="color:#fff;font-weight:bold">true</span>,<span style="color:#f00">
</span><span style="color:#f00"></span>    <span style="color:#007f7f">server_implementation</span> =&gt; <span style="color:#0ff;font-weight:bold">&#39;puppetserver&#39;</span>,<span style="color:#f00">
</span><span style="color:#f00"></span>}<span style="color:#f00">
</span><span style="color:#f00">
</span><span style="color:#f00"></span><span style="color:#fff;font-weight:bold">class</span> {<span style="color:#f00">
</span><span style="color:#f00"></span>  <span style="color:#0ff;font-weight:bold">&#39;::puppetdb::master::config&#39;</span>:<span style="color:#f00">
</span><span style="color:#f00"></span>    <span style="color:#007f7f">puppet_service_name</span> =&gt; <span style="color:#0ff;font-weight:bold">&#39;puppetserver&#39;</span>,<span style="color:#f00">
</span><span style="color:#f00"></span>}</code></pre></div>
<p><strong>What&rsquo;s around also works</strong></p>

<p>Hiera was working out of the box, just like PuppetDB. Great efforts have been taken to ensure an easy transition.</p>

<p>There is no configuration changed needed at that level also.</p>

<p><strong>As expected, it is slow, then fast</strong></p>

<p>The startup time is really really bigger than the old <code>passenger+httpd</code> stack. It take a very long time to start.</p>

<p>But that was expected and once it is started it is really more efficient and catalogs get compiled in no time.</p>

<p>I did not experience any troubles concerning on-disk file changes. Changes to the <code>.pp</code> files were automatically picked up by the server.</p>

<p><strong>Batteries not included</strong></p>

<p>What makes me a bit sad is the fact that <a href="https://docs.puppetlabs.com/pe/latest/puppet_server_metrics.html">Puppet Server Metrics</a> are completely closed source. Yes you can get a lot of these metrics by using tools like <a href="https://collectd.org/wiki/index.php/Plugin:puppet_reports">collectd</a>, but having the server sending them directly to a graphite server would have been very nice.</p>

<p>That would also have helped the community to join the Puppet Server boat. But they took their decision and there is no sign that it will change in the short time.</p>

<p><strong>I still like it</strong></p>

<p>Even if I am disappointed as a Puppet contributor to see that Puppetlabs is not open-sourcing the metrics part of Puppet Server, I still like the idea of having a good replacement for <code>httpd+passenger</code>. Playing with passenger RPM&rsquo;s used to be a pain in the past, and having an apache server is not ideal. With Puppet Server we have a robust daemon that is efficient.</p>

<p>I hope that the community will jump in to chase the bugs and write a new chapter in the Puppet story.</p>
