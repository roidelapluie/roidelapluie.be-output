      <title>About Devuan</title>

      <description>It looks like that a new Linux Distribution is born: Devuan. Yet another fork of Debian.
Debian is a really good ground for forks, it seems: Ubuntu, Linux Mint, and a lot of others. So, what does make this one different?
This fork wants to remove systemd from Debian. It is really strange that so many people are reacting against systemd so late. Systemd has been around for many years. I do not want to enter the debate about systemd.</description>

      <description> I have written a mcollective agent to run drush commands. It will help you to automate the deployments of your drupal websites.
I have implemented two drush commands so far:
 cache-clear updatedb  The full configuration is available on the github project.
Examples Updatedb ::text mco rpc drush updatedb root=/var/vhost/frontend-demo yes=true  Cache-clear ::text mco rpc drush cache-clear root=/var/vhost/frontend-demo uri=http://demo.example.net type=all  Links  mcollective drush the agent on github  </description>

      <title>Rattaching a running process to a screen</title>
      <link>https://roidelapluie.be/blog/2013/06/25/reptyr/</link>

      <description>Reptyr is a small project written in C that enable you to &amp;ldquo;re-pty&amp;rdquo; your process. It means you can, for example, attach a running process inside a screen.
For example, you launched irssi outside your screen, and you do not want to relaunch it.
Install reptyr, then, in a screen, run the following commands:
$ pidof irssi 27518 $ reptyr 27518  That&amp;rsquo;s it. The process will be rattached to Init but you will be able to use it directly from your screen, without notifying the difference.</description>
