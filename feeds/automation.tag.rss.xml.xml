      <title>Augeas resource for mgmt</title>

      <description>Last week, I joined the mgmt hackathon, just after Config Management Camp Ghent. It helped me understanding how mgmt actually works and that helped me to introduce two improvements in the codebase: prometheus support, and an augeas resource.
I will blog later about the prometheus support, today I will focus about the Augeas resource.
Defining a resource Currently, mgmt does not have a DSL, it only uses plain yaml.</description>

      <title>About Puppet 4.8</title>

      <description>Puppet, in its new parser (long known as «future parser»), allows you to do things like loops, lambda functions, &amp;hellip; And that was great. It was great because those were things we needed. We needed that so much that the community just went for its own variant, in ruby (create_resources). Being able to remove create_resources is great.
However, as Daniele stated, Puppet has quite reached Feature Complete. That means that we made Puppet work for all our needs.</description>

      <description>If you are a Puppet user, you know that you have multiple choices regarding the way you manage your files. You might decide to manage the whole file or parts of it. I presented that as part of my augeas talk at PuppetCamp London in 2014.
One of the solutions out there is concat. Concats allows you to define parts of a file as different resources, then glue them together to create a single file.</description>

      <title>A fix for the Puppet Agent not exiting with SIGINT</title>
      <link>https://roidelapluie.be/blog/2015/10/29/puppet-sigint/</link>

      <guid>https://roidelapluie.be/blog/2015/10/29/puppet-sigint/</guid>
      <description>Since Puppet 3.7.5 and 4.0.0, the Puppet Agent does not exit when it receives a SIGINT signal (^C). That is very annoying when developing Puppet modules.
A fix has been pushed yesterday by Josh Cooper for the next 3.x and 4.x releases. There is only one file changed, so if it&amp;rsquo;s really a problem for you, patching is trivial. Unfortunately it is not yet possible to easily rebuild the puppet-agent RPM, but that will come very soon.</description>

      <title>Foreman could get Puppet 4 support sooner than expected</title>

      <description>Foreman is one of the key tools of many puppet-based infrastructures. It can interact with the Puppet stack in different ways, by acting as a reporting dashboard or a complete ENC.
So far Foreman only supports up to Puppet 3. Puppet 4 brings in many changes, and that involves a lot of changes in the foreman side. Even the foreman-installer is based on Puppet.
But slowly, Puppet 4 supports starts to come to reality.</description>

      <title>pcsd limitations in EL7</title>
      <link>https://roidelapluie.be/blog/2015/09/17/pcsd/</link>

      <description>The High Availability stack shipped with CentOS/RHEL 7.1 comes with a daemon called pcsd that provides a web UI to manage a clusters. You can reach it at https://hostname:2224/.
I gave it a try and here is the list of limitations I have found so far:
 It does not show colocation sets at all. It does not show the &amp;ldquo;kind&amp;rdquo; of resource ordering preferences (optional, mandatory, serialize). It does not show failcounts.</description>

      <title>Debugging resource failures with pcs</title>
      <link>https://roidelapluie.be/blog/2015/09/16/pcs-resource-debug/</link>

      <description>Here is a small script to debug pacemaker resource failures in EL7.
It is more helpful than pcs resource debug-start and is based on the clusterlabs wiki.
All you need is to adapt resource= and operation=. You can also make an executable script that will take them as first and second parameter, as below:
#!/bin/bash resource=$1 operation=$2 # Unmanage the resource pcs resource unmanage $resource # OCF_ROOT is needed and might be OS dependent export OCF_ROOT=/usr/lib/ocf # Setting variables for the parameters eval $(pcs resource show $resource| grep Attributes:| awk &amp;#39;{$1=&amp;quot;&amp;quot;; print}&amp;#39;| tr &amp;quot; &amp;quot; &amp;quot;\n&amp;quot;| grep .</description>

      <title>Puppet 4 create_resource killer</title>

      <guid>https://roidelapluie.be/blog/2015/09/15/puppet-4-create-resources/</guid>
      <description>Puppet 4 brings very nice features that will definitely kill the create_resources function.
Parameters as a hash $parameters = { mode =&amp;gt; &amp;#39;0755&amp;#39;, content =&amp;gt; &amp;#39;foo&amp;#39;, } file { &amp;#39;/tmp/myfile&amp;#39;: * =&amp;gt; $parameters }  It is the same as:
file { &amp;#39;/tmp/myfile&amp;#39;: mode =&amp;gt; &amp;#39;0755&amp;#39;, content =&amp;gt; &amp;#39;foo&amp;#39;, }  Resource defaults file { default: mode =&amp;gt; &amp;#39;0755&amp;#39;, content =&amp;gt; &amp;#39;foo&amp;#39;; &amp;#39;/tmp/my_file1&amp;#39;:; &amp;#39;/tmp/my_file2&amp;#39;: mode =&amp;gt; &amp;#39;0644&amp;#39;, }  Is the same as:</description>

      <description>I have given a talk last week for the Belgian Puppet User Group about Puppet 4 and I would like to post here some practices I want to share with you, in order to have the cleanest Puppet code.
This can apply to all your local modules (not with the one you share with Puppet 3 users).
Type all the parameters Each parameter should have a type. You can use the Optional type but you should try to avoid some types as much as possible:</description>

      <title>Speed up Puppet and Augeas</title>
      <link>https://roidelapluie.be/blog/2015/08/19/speed-up-puppet-augeas/</link>

      <guid>https://roidelapluie.be/blog/2015/08/19/speed-up-puppet-augeas/</guid>
      <description>Here is a tip for those using the Puppet &amp;lsquo;augeas&amp;rsquo; native resource: always use the &amp;lsquo;incl&amp;rsquo; and the &amp;lsquo;lens&amp;rsquo; parameters.
Without that, Augeas will autoload all of the files defined in its lenses. On an empty VM that can take up to 1 second.
Here is my base test file:
$logrotate_file = &#39;/etc/logrotate.d/httpd&#39; augeas { &#39;logrotate-httpd&#39;: context =&amp;gt; &amp;quot;/files${logrotate_file}/rule/&amp;quot;, changes =&amp;gt; [ &#39;set schedule daily&#39;, &#39;set rotate 6&#39;, &#39;set compress compress&#39;, ], }  It takes 0.</description>

      <title>A Puppet module for Puppet 4</title>
      <link>https://roidelapluie.be/blog/2015/07/26/puppet-puppet-4/</link>

      <description>I have been working today on a pull request for the puppet-puppet module. That module, part of the foreman puppet modules suite, is probably the most used in its category.
The pull request I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on is about support of the new &amp;lsquo;All In One&amp;rsquo; package and Puppet 4. It will probably be merged very soon.
An important part of the work was done by Mickaël Canévet, from camptocamp. I did polish it a bit, rebase it and make the tests pass.</description>

      <description>I have tested Puppet Server, the new puppet master implementation in Clojure. And I am quite happy.
It just works
The first amazing thing was that it did just work the same way as Puppetmaster.
I did not need to change any configuration file. Every custom function and module just worked like before.
I am using the puppet-puppet from the Foreman, which already have a server_implementation parameter. Switching it to puppetserver just did the trick.</description>

      <description>This article has been triggered by M@ttias.be&amp;rsquo;s article.
I have been working for Inuits for 3 years, with Puppet 2.6. By that time Puppet 0.23 was still around in many places. Here are some lessons I&amp;rsquo;ve learned during these years.
Your Puppet code is code This is one of the first lessons I&amp;rsquo;ve learned. In the many environments I&amp;rsquo;ve seen, some of them use some git hooks/rsync/whatever to deploy the puppet code to the different platforms.</description>

      <title>Pcs support merged into puppetlabs-corosync</title>

      <description>Great news for people using an el-based distribution and the puppetlabs-corosync puppet module: pcs support has been merged into master.
This change is important because it means that all the RPM required for these providers are in the main repositories, which ensure they are tested and supported.
Starting from CentOS 6.4, the crm shell was not provided by Red Hat anymore, but the puppet module was using that package in its only provider for custom types.</description>

      <description>Dear puppet users using a yum-based distribution1, once you will upgrade to puppet 3.6.1, you will notice the following warning message each time you use a package type:
Warning: The package type&#39;s allow_virtual parameter will be changing its default value from false to true in a future release. If you do not want to allow virtual packages, please explicitly set allow_virtual to false. (at /usr/lib/ruby/site_ruby/1.8/puppet/type.rb:816:in `set_default&#39;)  There is nothing you can do with that except setting a global parameter in your puppet tree, as stated in the release notes:</description>

      <description>Dear puppet users using a yum-based distribution, if you use the Yumrepo resource type, don&amp;rsquo;t upgrade to puppet 3.5.0. That resource type has been rewritten and the release has come with very annoying bugs.
Bugs  PUP-2163: yumrepo resource completely broken PUP-2150: yumrepo removable URL properties cannot be set to ‘absent’ PUP-2179: Ensuring absent on a yumrepo removes all repos in the same file PUP-2178: yumrepo ‘descr’ property doesn’t map to the ‘name’ INI property PUP-2181: Setting yumrepo string properties to absent assigns the literal ‘absent’ string  Fixes Fixes have been merged to master and will be released with Puppet 3.</description>

      <description>I have written a small frontend to Foreman and its Puppet integration.
The only goal is to provide our developers to change the puppet parameters of their hosts in an easy way, and to rebuild the nodes in a few clicks.
The project consists is presented as a single web page, where you make changes. Angularjs makes that page reactive.
It requires admin rights on foreman (it uses the API).</description>
