      <description>Here are the Robot Framework keywords needed nowadays to setup a socks5 proxy (e.g ssh -ND 9050 bastion.example.com):

      <title>My first Open Source contribution</title>

      <description>The first Open-Source contribution I remember happened on December 2005. It happened on Gaim, which is now known as Pidgin.
It was not a big contribution: I did not like the arrows shown when moving discussion tabs. Those arrows where plain red. I created new ones (using The Gimp), with a gradient. It did not take a long time to make them, but it was definitively an improvement.
Here it is: It was quickly merged (&amp;lt; 2 hours).</description>

      <description>At Config Management Camp, James was once again presenting mgmt. He presented the project one year ago, on his blog. There are multiple ideas behind mgmt (as you can read on his blog):
 Parallel execution Event driven Distributed topology  And all of that makes a lot of sense. I really like it. I do really think that this might become a huge deal in the future. But there are a couple of concerns I would like to raise.</description>

      <title>I&#39;ve backed Matchstick</title>

      <description>I have backed Matchstick, the HDMI stick based on Firefox OS. It is the first crowdfunding project I participate. And I hope it won&amp;rsquo;t be the last one.
There are a few reasons why I have chosen to do so.
The first reason is the open-source part of that project. An open-source software combined with open-source hardware, that is everything I like. Good philosophy is always a good point.
Next that project is exciting.</description>
