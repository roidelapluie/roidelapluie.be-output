      <description>Foreman is one of the key tools of many puppet-based infrastructures. It can interact with the Puppet stack in different ways, by acting as a reporting dashboard or a complete ENC.
So far Foreman only supports up to Puppet 3. Puppet 4 brings in many changes, and that involves a lot of changes in the foreman side. Even the foreman-installer is based on Puppet.
But slowly, Puppet 4 supports starts to come to reality.</description>

      <description>I have written a small frontend to Foreman and its Puppet integration.
The only goal is to provide our developers to change the puppet parameters of their hosts in an easy way, and to rebuild the nodes in a few clicks.
The project consists is presented as a single web page, where you make changes. Angularjs makes that page reactive.
It requires admin rights on foreman (it uses the API).</description>
