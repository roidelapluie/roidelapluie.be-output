      <description>Google is shutting down Google Code. It was quite expected that it would join the Google graveyard. It was a cool service but the UI never got a lot of attention. Parsing a source tree or looking at issues was like traveling back in 2006.
This should however be a reminder that all of these platforms (Google Code, Github, Bitbucket) are centralized and closed-source. Even if Github loves Open-Source, and is loved by the Open-Source community, it is a totally closed platform.</description>
