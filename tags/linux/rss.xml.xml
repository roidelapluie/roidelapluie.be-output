      <description>While introducing Ansible at customer, I noticed the following problem while using ansible become feature:
sudo: unable to create /var/log/sudo-io/170718-124212: File exists sudo: error initializing I/O plugin sudoers_io  That was because in the sudoers configuration, you have:
Defaults syslog=auth,log_input,log_output,iolog_file=%y%m%d-%H%M%S  Which means that sudo sessions will be logged, but there can only be one sudo session per second. While discussing with colleagues what would be the best way to address this &amp;ndash; several options are possible: not logging, logging with seq (Defaults:ansible iolog_file=ansible/%{seq}), logging microseconds, &amp;hellip; &amp;ndash; I have implemented a workaround.</description>

      <description>In the coming months, I will run several workshops about Jenkins. Those workshops will be hands-on, so people will bring their own laptops to hack on Jenkins instances.
For that, I expect lots of them will simply run Jenkins on their laptops, or use an external laptop. But, as a backup, or a primary solution, I plan to provision multiple instances of Jenkins, ready to be used, in the cloud.</description>

      <title>It&#39;s not time to split Linux distros in two</title>

      <description>This article is a reaction to the following article: It&amp;rsquo;s time to split Linux distros in two written by @pvenezia.
There are a lot of changes nowadays in the way GNU/Linux evolves: systemd, steamOS, android, and a bunch of other stuff in several domains.
So I read Paul&amp;rsquo;s article with attention because it&amp;rsquo;s seems that GNU/Linux will evolve a lot in the following years. He is right when he points out that on one side we want stability and scalability and on the other side we want performances and wide hardware support.</description>

      <title>Puppet-corosync and pcs provider</title>
      <link>https://roidelapluie.be/blog/2014/01/28/puppet-corosync-pcs/</link>

      <description>Since the release 6.4, el-based distributions are not shipped with the crm command by default. pcs is the new recommended way to setup the clusters on CentOS/RHEL &amp;gt;= 6.4.
A lot of the people using the puppetlabs-corosync module have been surprised and they just installed a RPM found somewhere across the web.
I adapted the puppetlabs-corosync to end that dependency. My puppetlabs-corosync module is available here.
It is not perfect, but I still plan on working on it in the following months (and I accept pull requests of course).</description>
